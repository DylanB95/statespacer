## Overview
statespacer is a package for state space modelling in R. It provides functions that make estimating models in State Space form a breeze. This package implements state-of-the-art algorithms developed by various time series practitioners such as J. Durbin and S.J. Koopman. Details about the algorithms can be found in their book, "Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods".

If you are new to statespacer, check out `vignette("intro", "statespacer")` for a quick start to the statespacer package! Also check out the references for the following functions:

* `StateSpaceFit()` for fitting State Space models.
* `StateSpaceForecast()` for producing forecasts using fitted State Space models.
* `StateSpaceEval()` for evaluating State Space models at user specified parameters.

## State Space Components
This package supports numerous state space components:

* The Local Level
* The Local Level + Slope
* Smoothing Splines
* Trigonometric Seasonality, BSM
* Cycles
* Business Cycles
* Explanatory Variables
* Explanatory Variables with time-varying coefficients
* Explanatory Variables in the Local Level
* Explanatory Variables in the Local Level + Slope
* ARIMA
* SARIMA

These components can be used for both univariate, as multivariate models. The components can be combined in order to get more extensive models. Moreover, the user can control the format of the variance - covariance matrices of each of the components. This way, one could specify the components to be deterministic instead of stochastic. In the multivariate case, one could impose rank restrictions on the variance - covariance matrices such that commonalities in the components are estimated, like common levels, common slopes, etc.

## Fitting Procedure
The package employs a univariate treatment, and an exact initialisation for diffuse elements, to estimate the state parameters and compute the loglikelihood.

## Installation

You can install statespacer with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DylanB95/statespacer")
```
