title: "Fitting ARIMA models with statespacer"
description: >
  A lot of time series exhibit some form of seasonality. In this vignette you 
  will learn how to deal with seasonality using the statespacer package. 
  Moreover, you will learn how to add explanatory variables to the State Space 
  model, and how to estimate multivariate models if there is more than one 
  dependent variable available.
