This document provides extensive details about the object as returned by `StateSpaceFit()`. In order to do so, we start with introducing the form of the general linear Gaussian state space model, following the notation used by @durbin2012time. Obtaining a grasp of the notation used will help to get the most out of the statespacer package!

## The general linear Gaussian state space model
There are many ways to write down the form of the general linear Gaussian state space model. We use the form used by @durbin2012time:

$$
\begin{aligned}
 y_t ~ &= ~ Z_t\alpha_t ~ + ~ \varepsilon_t, ~~~~~~~~~~ \varepsilon_t ~ \sim ~ N(0, ~ H_t), \\
 \alpha_{t+1} ~ &= ~ T_t\alpha_t ~ + ~ R_t\eta_t, ~~~~~~ \eta_t ~ \sim ~ N(0, ~ Q_t),
\end{aligned}
$$

where $y_t$ is the *observation vector*, a $p ~ \times ~ 1$ vector of dependent variables at time $t$. $\alpha_t$ is the unobserved *state vector*, a $m ~ \times ~ 1$ vector of state variables at time $t$. $\varepsilon_t$ and $\eta_t$ are disturbance vectors of respectively the observation equation, and the state equation. The matrices $Z_t$, $H_t$, $T_t$, $R_t$, and $Q_t$ are called the *system matrices* of the state space model. Different specifications of the system matrices, lead to different interpretations of the model.

## The object as returned by StateSpaceFit
Having obtained a better understanding of the notation used, it is easier to find our way in the object as returned by `StateSpaceFit()`. Let's say we store the object of StateSpaceFit in a variable called `fit`, that is, `fit <- StateSpaceFit(...)`. `fit` is then a list, containing many items, including other lists. This section describes the items that are included in `fit` one by one.
